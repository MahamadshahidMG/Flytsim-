# Flytsim-
Flytsim simulation of triangle pattern and square pattern.
1. Square pattern:
   In this code the drone taken off at 5m, moved in a square pattern of side length of 6.5m at a height of 5m, and landed once the entire mission is completed.
   
2. Triangle pattern:
   In this code the drone is taken off at 10m, moved in the triangle pattern of the side length 10m at a height of 10m, and landed once the entire mission is completed.
